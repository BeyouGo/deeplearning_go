# INFO8010: Deep learning

This repository contains an attempt of transfer learning from a pretrained model for the game of Go on a 19x19 board to a target model used on a 9x9 board.

## Current tasks
### Research
* [ ] Find how to compare AIs
* [ ] Research what types of model to use or alteration of models

### Code
* [ ] Check when game is over and actually end the game when playing
* [ ] Save models once trained
* [ ] Automate the AI comparison using saved models and weights

### Execution
* [ ] Train models

### Reporting
* [ ] Summarize work done
* [ ] Summarize results obtained
* [ ] Slides
